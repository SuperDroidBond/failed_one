# Read ro.boot.hardware.sku. Needed by Regulatory Info screen of Settings app.
# Normally this property is a default_prop which is readable by anybody, but on marlin/sailfish
# init_mid needs to be able to set this property and thus this property had to be relabelled as
# a new type, hw_sku_pop. This in turn requires us to grant system_app read access to this property
# label.

# Needed by Settings app's TelephonyMonitorPreferenceController, available only on a subset of
# userdebug and eng devices
